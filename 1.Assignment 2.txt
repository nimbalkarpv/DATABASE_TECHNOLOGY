4) Why isnâ€™t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
->
  a) When you select a table the order of raws in the output it depends on row address.
  b) it will always be in ascending order of row address.
  c) when you update a raw if row length is increasing then the entire row can be moved to another address.
  d) later when you select from the table we will find the row at some other position in the output.
  e) Its only in the case of VARCHAR that the row length may be increase or decrease. 

Hence it is not possible to view the first or last 'N' rows of a table.
